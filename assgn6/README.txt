Notes:
- Keeps track of # of ORDERS with cart items with session storage. (Eg: if you order 12 original, and 12 blueberry, the cart will show 2 orders.) 
- Updates the flavor based on what is selected in the product page
- Alert message has error prevention to allow user to check their order
- Selecting quantity updates subtotal in the details page
- Buttons show feedback of the glazing selection (visually and stores the value)
- Buttons show feedback of the quantity selection (visually and stores the value)
- Using session storage to keep track of cart items because it made more sense than local storage for this assignment (don't need to constantly delete local storage).
